# Sheepdog Dino
My entry for the Ludum Dare 33 game jam.
Created in 72 hours.

Made with JavaScript and my own game engine with the HTML5 canvas.

You are the monster, a dinosaur! Humans are frightened of you, use this to your advantage to save them! Humans will run away from you, guide them to safety and progress through the levels.
